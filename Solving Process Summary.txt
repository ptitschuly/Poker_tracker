Solving Process Summary
The task was to create a Python script with a graphical user interface (GUI) to calculate the Chip Expected Value (CEV) for poker scenarios, specifically tailored for 3-way and heads-up Sit & Go formats. The GUI needed to allow users to input scenario details and display the calculated CEV.

The solving process involved several steps:

Set up the UI: The initial step focused on creating the basic GUI structure using tkinter and ttk. This involved setting up the main window, creating frames to group inputs (Scenario Details, Player and Hand Details, Opponent and Action Details), and adding labels, entry fields, a combobox for player action, and a label for displaying the result. The grid layout manager was used for arrangement.
Implement Input Handling: A function get_input_values was created to read the data entered by the user into the various GUI widgets. This function retrieved the text from entry widgets and the selected value from the combobox, storing them in a dictionary.
Integrate with Poker Logic: A new function calculate_ev_from_gui was implemented. This function was designed to take the dictionary of input values obtained from the GUI, parse them into the data structures required by the core poker calculation logic (e.g., Player objects, Hand objects, PokerScenario), and then call the existing calculate_chip_ev function. Helper functions (parse_hand_string, parse_community_cards_string) were created to handle string-to-object conversion.
Display Results: The calculate_ev_from_gui function was modified to not only perform the calculation but also update the designated result label (ev_result_label) in the GUI with the calculated Chip EV. Error handling was integrated to display error messages in the same label if input parsing or calculation failed.
Add Interactivity: A button labeled "Calculate EV" was added to the GUI. Its command was configured to call the calculate_ev_from_gui function, passing the dictionary of GUI elements, thus triggering the calculation when clicked.
Refine UI (optional): An attempt was made to improve the GUI layout by adjusting padding, using sub-frames for better alignment, configuring column weights for responsiveness, and setting default values. However, this step could not be fully verified or completed due to the execution environment lacking a graphical display.
Error Handling (optional): Comprehensive input validation was added within the calculate_ev_from_gui function. This included checks for valid number formats, non-negative values for stacks and blinds, correct hand/card formats, and logical constraints like overlaps between hole cards and community cards. Informative error messages were generated and displayed in the result label.
Data Analysis Key Findings
The tkinter library with ttk widgets provides a suitable framework for building simple graphical interfaces in Python.
Using ttk.LabelFrame and nested ttk.Frames helps organize complex input forms logically.
The grid layout manager, when combined with column/row weights and sticky options, allows for responsive GUI layouts that adapt to window resizing.
Robust input validation is crucial for a GUI application, requiring checks for expected data types, formats, ranges, and logical consistency between inputs.
Centralizing the input parsing and calculation logic in a dedicated function (calculate_ev_from_gui) makes the code modular and easier to manage.
Providing clear feedback to the user, both for successful calculations and errors, is essential for a good user experience.

Insights or Next Steps
Implement Input Validation Feedback: Instead of just displaying an error message in the result label, consider highlighting the specific input field that has an error.
Add ICM Calculation: Extend the application to include Independent Chip Model (ICM) calculations, potentially with a checkbox or option to switch between Chip EV and ICM EV.
